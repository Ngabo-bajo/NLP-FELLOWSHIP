UN Women Rwanda,Consultancy,Terms of Reference for Production Of the Second Generation of the Country Gender Status Report for Rwanda,https://www.jobinrwanda.com/job/terms-reference-production-second-generation-country-gender-status-report-rwanda,"Economics, Other, Social sciences",Master  ,Senior (5+ years of experience), Contract,1,RW,614,"
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PRODUCTION OF THE SECOND GENERATION OF THE COUNTRY GENDER STATUS REPORT FOR RWANDA
Background
The Government of Rwanda has made women’s empowerment and inclusion a hallmark of recovery and reconstruction of the Country. This approach has been globally hailed as novel in both intent and scope. Gender Equality in the country is driven by the political will at the highest levels, the establishment of National Gender Machinery Institutions (Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, Gender Monitoring Office, National Women’s Council), existing favorable policies and programs including home grown solutions as well as the revision and amendment of discriminatory laws or adoption of gender related laws such as: Law Governing Land in Rwanda which guarantees equal rights on land access, ownership and utilization; Law establishing and governing maternity leave benefits scheme where a woman is allowed 3 months fully paid maternity leave and 4 days of paternity leave to name a few.
In its reconstruction journey, Rwanda has also a story to tell, a story of great achievements in several fields and specifically in positioning Gender Equality to the highest level of a constitutional fundamental principle of human rights, good governance and democracy. Several assessments demonstrate Rwanda’s achievements such as the World Economic Gender Gap Report of 2022 which ranks Rwanda as the sixth country world wide out of 146 Countries on ability to close the Gender Gap in four fundamental areas namely; Economic Participaton and opportunity, Education, Health and Surival as well as Political Empowerment. In addition, Rwandan women in leadership have played a pivotal role in the country’s political, economic and social development at all levels in the country. In Parliament, women are represented at 61.3% while 30.3% as Heads of public institutions, 40% as Governors, 42% in Judiciary and 27% as presidents of District Councils. 
In relation to economic empowerment, Finscope Rwanda 2020 report states that only 8% of Rwandan women are financially excluded compared to 32% in 2012 and women have embraced existing opportunities including their enrolment and participation in saving groups whereby 49% of them (women) have a formal way of saving compared to 61% of their male counterparts. ICT development in Rwanda has widened women’s education and financial opportunities among others. In Education, Rwanda has promoted the enrolment of women in STEM fields whereby in Secondary schools, in 2020/2021, 48.4% of Girls were enrolled in STEM options versus 62.5 % of their male counterparts. 
Within the health sector, the health workforce and infrastructure development, innovative data collection tools including Rapid SMS for emergency labor and tracking the Maternal and Child health continuum of care have resulted in considerable decrease of maternal and infant mortality rates. For example, DHS, 2019/2020 highlighted that the maternal mortality ratio has declined significantly to 203 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019/2020 from 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2014-2015 down from 1071 in 2000 and the distribution of women aged 15-49 using modern contraceptive method stood at 58.4%.
However, with the outbreak of COVID-19, the socio-economic trajectory of Rwanda alike many other countries in the world was negatively altered, with the Exports and Tourism sectors the most hit amid disruption in international trade and travels. Recent assessments carried out on the impact of COVID-19 in Rwanda have consistently shown that women are adversely affected by COVID-19 economically due to their high involvement in the informal sector and underrepresentation in the digital economy, unsecure employment, as well as high involvement in unpaid care work and in subsistence farming. For instance, a recent Covid-19 Gender Rapid Assessment commissioned by the Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MIGEPROF) in partnership with UN Women and UNFPA found that a high proportion of rural and urban women (59% and 52% respectively) reported closure of their businesses as a result of the pandemic, compared to 49% for men in both rural and urban areas. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated women and girls’ vulnerability to GBV. GBV data released by RIB have shown an increase of GBV cases from 969 cases in March 2020 to 1,243 cases in June 2020 translating to 28.3 % increase in only three months of COVID-19
In addition, Rwanda still faces some challenges that require concerted efforts to address gender equality related barriers and ensure the creation of robust gender accountability systems to advance the relevant GEWE legal and policy commitments. The country has charted its way to reaching a Middle-Income Country (MIC) status and has been implementing Vision 2050 the framework that will see the Country’s accountability to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.
To sustain the efforts to track the implementation of gender equality commitments and in line with the objectives of the State of Gender Equality in Rwanda (2019), the Gender Monitoring Office (GMO) in collaboration with UN WOMEN seeks to generate and disseminate a report that provides an up to date information on the status of gender equality including progress and gaps to provide evidence that informs policy priorities, decisions and initiatives to advance the country’s development agenda. In this context, UN WOMEN on behalf of Gender Monitoring Office seeks to hire a senior consultant to develop a second generation of the ‘’Country Gender Status Report (CGSR).’’
Objectives of the assignment
The main purpose of producing the second-generation Country Gender Status Report is to document and showcase Rwanda’s achievements on gender equality promotion, women’s empowerment across different sectors, the prevailing challenges, the promising practices and recommendations on priorities requiring much focus and action.
Specific objectives of the assignment include;

Identify good practices and lessons learned from relevant GEWE related initiatives at national and local levels in Rwanda.
Outline strategic recommendations to accelerate the advancement of gender equality and the empowerment of women in Rwanda.
Produce a policy brief reflecting key issues and related recommendations across the Government Pillars as enshrined in the report.
Scope of the assignment
The Second generation of the Country Gender Status Report development will cover the period of 2018 to date. The report will embark on the indicators used in the 1st generation with a possibility of adding new indicators where deemed necessary.

About Yellow
Yellow’s goal is to build an enduring business that makes life better for our customers and creates great lives for our team. We provide solar-power electricity solutions and financed smartphones which makes these life changing products affordable to bottom of the pyramid households.
Our story is simple- we want our customers to enjoy a better life with energy in their home with a financed solar system, internet all the time with a financed smartphone and afford them opportunities through an ecosystem of digital and financial services.
We started selling through a network of rural agents and managed them remotely with technology, through a web-based platform we have developed called Ofeefee. Our operation is lean because it uses exponential tech solutions, which allows us to efficiently meet the challenges of last-mile distribution. But NOW…
What will you be joining?
Instead of launching first with an agent based network such as our previous ventures in Malawi and Uganda, we are first going to start by selling through urban based smartphone merchants (smartphone merchant shops). We want to understand in the quickest and least stock intensive way - how customers in each respective country repay their loans and can we become the biggest sustainable smartphone financing company in Africa.
Who are we looking for?

Expression of Interest (EOI) Event management for the Pharma Conference in Kigali, Rwanda
Reference number : 83425829
General information
The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is a federally owned international cooperation enterprise for sustainable development with worldwide operations. GIZ has worked in Rwanda for over 30 years. The primary objectives between the Government of Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region and the Federal Republic of Germany are poverty reduction and promotion of sustainable development. To achieve these objectives, GIZ Rwanda is active in the sectors of Decentralization and Good Governance, Economic Development and Employment Promotion, Energy and ICT (Information and Communications Technology), Natural Resources, Peace and Security and Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).
Brief information on the project
In Rwanda, the cluster “sustainable economic development” includes the Special Initiative on Job Creation and Training (SI Jobs), which is financed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The recently commissioned component on “Job partnerships and SME promotion in the pharmaceutical sector” is officially part of the “Special Initiative for Training and Job Creation” (hereafter referred to as SI Jobs) in Rwanda.
It is financed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and aims at strengthening the pharmaceutical and bio-technological sector in Rwanda. It focuses on the following measures:
Strengthening the regulatory framework and governance for pharmaceutical and biotechnological products;  
Improving opportunities for qualification and training measures for professions at different levels in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological sector; 
Investment promotion and support networking between Rwandan and international actors in the pharmaceutical and biotechnological sector. 
Context
Rwanda heavily depends on the import of medicines and vaccines. To ensure access to affordable and quality pharmaceuticals, the Government of Rwanda decided to transform the country into a regional hub for pharmaceutical manufacturing. However, the sector is still in its infantry, with very limited industry and the workforce required to build up the sector is almost absent. Thererfore, the investment of BioNTech is considered vital to attract more companies and to build a conducive ecosystem needed for pharmaceutical production.
To successfully build a conducive ecosystem for the pharmaceutical and biotechnological sector, a range of interlinked elements need to be put in place and a close collaboration among stakeholders is essential. Moreover, potential investors have a range of questions they consider before entering a new market.
A pharma conference will be conveined with the aim to attract potential investments to successfully develop the pharmaceutical and biotechnological sector in Rwanda. The conference shall support the networking among stakeholders across sectors, promote Rwanda as location for potential investments and attract business and academic interest.
The 2- or 3-day (still tbd) conference shall take place in early 2023 (preferably March) in Kigali. Particpants will come from a range of different sectors, including government, regulatory bodies, industry, education, civil society and development cooperation. The conference’s program will include a range of different elements such as investors’ meetings, a tour through the regulatory institution, a visit to the special economic zone, market place and other side meetings.
While the content of the conference will be planned with the Rwandan partners and relevant experts, there is need for support of planning (logistically) and execution of the event in Kigali, Rwanda.
Objective of the assignment
The objective of the assignment is to support the planning and execution of the conference in Kigali.
Contract term
GIZ is looking for an experience event organiser consulting firm to manage the organisation of the above mentioned Pharma Conference.

For support in the content-related preparation of the conference, GIZ will also contract an international expert for pharmaceutical production. In some instances, close coordination between the contractor and the international expert will be required.
GIZ shall hire the contractor for the anticipated contract term, from 15.12.2022 until

Who We Are
At EarthEnable, we believe that our clients deserve our very best, that the best ideas can come from any part of the company, and that failure is necessary for success. We celebrate each other’s wins, learn from our setbacks, and are deeply proud of the impact we make every day. We believe that a clean, dust-free home means more than good health. It means pride and dignity in the place our customers most treasure: their homes. Being a part of our team means more than building housing products: it means building an organization and building a better future for rural families.
What We Do
EarthEnable is transforming the way people live, by making homes healthier for families across rural Rwanda and Uganda. 65% of Rwandans and Ugandans live in homes with dirt floors which are dusty, unsanitary, and fertile breeding grounds for parasites and germs. While replacing a dirt floor with concrete has significant health benefits (e.g. reducing diarrhea by 50% and parasitic infections by 80%), concrete is unaffordable for many who need it.
EarthEnable addresses this pressing and ubiquitous problem by selling high-quality, earthen housing products that are 80% cheaper than concrete equivalents with 90% less embedded energy. Earthen construction is already prevalent in modern homes across the world, and we have innovated on distribution models that make our products ultra-affordable. EarthEnable trains and certifies local franchisees to install our products which are sealed using our proprietary drying oil that makes them waterproof, strong, and polished.

ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND
Smart Africa is a bold and innovative commitment from African Heads of State and Government to accelerate sustainable socio-economic development on the continent, ushering Africa into a knowledge economy through affordable access to Broadband and usage of Information and Communications Technologies.  
The Smart Africa Manifesto aims to put ICT at the center of national socio-economic development agenda of member countries and promote the introduction of advanced technologies in telecommunication, as well as leverage ICT to promote sustainable development.

Context
The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH is a federally owned international cooperation enterprise for sustainable development with worldwide operations. GIZ has worked in Rwanda for over 30 years. The primary objectives between the Government of Rwanda and the Federal Republic of Germany are poverty reduction and promotion of sustainable development. To achieve these objectives, GIZ Rwanda is active in the sectors of Decentralization and Good Governance, Economic Development and Employment Promotion, Energy, and ICT (Information and Communications Technology). The GIZ project ""Digital Solutions for Sustainable Development"" (DSSD) has a mandate to advise Rwandan institutions on the implementation of the Smart Rwanda Master Plan (2016-2020) and its priority projects. The project also aims to promote the development of digital solutions in collaboration with sector ministries, local and international private companies, research institutions and civil society. 
The Digital Solutions for Sustainable Development project entered a new phase in 2021. In addition to digital solutions that are being developed together with the Rwandan partner authorities. One of the project objectives is designed to develop initiatives to promote digital participation in collaboration between public and private stakeholders.

International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN),Consultancy,Terms of Reference (ToR) for the Recruitment of National Short-term Consultant to deliver Trainings on Compost Making Technology for Farmers within Sebeya Catchment Project,https://www.jobinrwanda.com/job/terms-reference-tor-recruitment-national-short-term-consultant-deliver-trainings-compost-making,"Agriculture, Other",Bachelor  ,Senior (5+ years of experience), Contract,1,RW,453,"
Terms of Reference (ToR) for the recruitment of National Short-term Consultant to deliver Trainings on compost making technology for farmers within Sebeya catchment Project.  
Project Background 
The “Embedding Integrated Water Resource Management in Rwanda” (EWMR) project (also referred to as the ‘Landscape and Integrated Water Resources Management and Restoration in Sebeya and other catchments, Rwanda’) is a three-year project from May 2019 to June 2022, funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom of Netherlands (EKN) and implemented by the Rwanda Water resources Board (RWB) with Technical Assistance (TA) from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and its consortium partners the Netherlands Development Organisation (SNV) and Rwanda Rural Rehabilitation Initiative (RWARRI). The project seeks to increase livelihood and conservation Benefits in Sebeya (& other) catchments from restoration and improved land management. 
By applying the Nature-based Solutions approach, the EWMR Project has directly contributed to food security, water security, human health, economic and social development, disaster risk reduction, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and reduction of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss.
At the end of the project, EKN and IUCN agreed upon the extend the project for 1 year from July 2022 to June 2023 in order to address the need for building back restored landscapes in the post-covid-19 era, strengthening local resilience in face of rising global food prices, and deepening further sustainability for the communities in the project area.
Community based approaches 
The EWMR project is anchored on community-based approach and in recognition of diverse community needs and priorities, it is crucial to incorporate various agricultural technologies that can help farmers to increase farm productivity and gain much more income to improve the community livelihoods.   
However, Crop Intensification Program (CIP) in Rwanda prioritizes high potential crops depending on the area and there are some recommended inputs (like manure from livestock, quality compost made from potential local biomass) to incorporate in soil in addition to other Climate Resilient Agriculture practices. 
Compost making technology presents an opportunity for multiple benefits like income generation from sale of good quality compost while contributing to the environmental restoration in terms of bio-physical soil conservation. 
Rationale for the assignment 
Following recommendations based on community led Village Land Use Actions Plans (VLUAPs), scoping exercises and relevant stakeholders in agriculture sector across the 4 districts, there is need for organic manure to support agricultural production. However, the farmers lack of knowledge and skills in compost making for production of good quality organic manure resulting less than optimal productivity for crops such as potato, maize, beans, and other horticultural crops. There is an urgent need to build the capacity of farmers in production of organic manure through compost making to improve soil health and fertility and consequently enhance productivity of their farms.  Therefore, the training on compost making will equip the farmers with relevant knowledge and skills that will help enable them to produce own organic manure through composting farm and animal waste.  
Overall objectives of the consultancy

RTI International is part of a consortium, led by the Palladium Group, that works with the Government of Rwanda (GOR) to implement the Rwanda Integrated Health Systems Activity (RIHSA) with funding from USAID. GOR is currently seeking to secure financial protection and ensure equity in access to health services.

In Rwanda, Health Committees provide input and advice to the Director General of a Referral Hospital; at the district level, they oversee auditing, monitoring, and evaluating a hospital’s activities, administration, and financial management. Improving the governance and stewardship capabilities of hospitals in Rwanda requires strengthening these Hospital Committees so that they can perform their oversight and support roles for hospital management.

Gather required documentation from the MOH, understand agenda requirements, collate the guidance, and document the agenda requirements.

Call for Expression of Interest (EoI) to develop training manual on financial literacy and business skills for actors in the vegetable value chains.
Background information
Kilimo Trust (KT) is a not-for-profit organization working on agriculture and agribusiness for development and creation of employment opportunities across East Africa (Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, and Burundi).
Kilimo Trust Rwanda is leading the implementation of a 5-years initiative (2022-2026) titled Good Food for Cities (GFC) Project funded by the Belgian Government (DGD) through Rikolto SON to support farmers to increase production and commercialization of affordable, healthy, and nutritious food produced using regenerative and other sustainable production practices.

Result 3 – Enabling Environment: an enabling policy, financial and normative environment at local, national, and international level which will incentivizes Healthy, Sustainable and Nutritious (HSN) diets in East African Cities.
Generally, the project focuses on professionalization of smallholder farmers in Rubavu District to increase vegetables production, postharvest handling, marketing, and market access with emphasis on regenerative agriculture practices.
Purpose of the call and scope of the assignment
Overall, financial institutions consider agriculture production a risky business due to its high vulnerability to external shocks (including extreme weather events, pest, and diseases and nature of seasonality).
The uptake of the existing agri-financing facilities by agro-food chain actors is reported by BNR to still be low. This is partly related to lending conditions such as high interest rates (up to 19%) which reflects the high risks and lack of collateral, especially associated with smallholders and agricultural SMEs (given their higher reliance on variable rains and particularly low investment returns).
More investments in agriculture could be made to boost agri-value chains financing and food system in Rubavu district. This can be done, in principle, by improving the incentive system of financial institutions and easing the conditions for collateral by also accepting, for example, land leases, off-taker agreements or agri-equipment as collateral (thus also redistributing risks among different value chain stakeholders) or adapting repayment schemes to farming cycles. This may go hand in hand with the provision of financial education and business management skills for the agri-chain actors.
Therefore, Kilimo Trust invites applications from eligible consultant (s) or firm that will work in close consultation with GFC project team to develop a training manual/aid on financial literacy and business skills to equip vegetables value chain actors with a set of skills and knowledge that allows an individual to make informed and effective decisions with all of their financial resources.
The training manual/aid should be developed in English with Kinyarwanda translation.
Required expertise and experience
The firm or the consultant (s) MUST have demonstrated experience in developing similar training manuals.
Ready to showcase to Kilimo Trust some of the previously developed similar training manuals.
At least 3 years of relevant professional experience in similar work.
Tasks
Development of a training manual that will be used to build the capacity of actors in the vegetables value chains for a better understanding of financial components and skills such as budgeting, investing, borrowing, taxation, and personal financial management.
Design and submit final artwork of the training manual to Kilimo Trust.
Translate the approved training manual in Kinyarwanda.
Timeline
The assignment is expected to start in November 2022 and run for a period of 30 days from the time of signing a contract.
Application Procedure
Interested and eligible consultant(s) or firm shall submit the following:
Expression of interest addressed to the Human Resource Manager of Kilimo Trust.

CARE International Rwanda,Consultancy,Terms of Reference for Conducting a Market Landscape and Business Case Modeling Focused on Agriculture in Rwanda,https://www.jobinrwanda.com/job/terms-reference-conducting-market-landscape-and-business-case-modeling-focused-agriculture,"Agriculture, Business, Marketing and sales, Other",Bachelor  ,Senior (5+ years of experience), Contract,1,RW,189,"
Terms of Reference for conducting a market landscape and business case modeling focused on agriculture in Rwanda
Background
Founded in 1945, CARE is a global leader within a worldwide movement dedicated to ending poverty. We seek a world of hope, tolerance, and social justice, where poverty has been overcome and all people live with dignity and security; and we work around the globe to save lives, defeat poverty and achieve social justice. We put women and girls in the centre because we know that we cannot overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities.
In 2018, CARE and Bloomberg Philanthropies established a partnership to support women in Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) to increase their incomes through collective investment in high-potential agribusiness enterprises. The AgriFund model has been developed by CARE to build on our experience in forming VSLAs as platforms for women to pursue economic opportunities and improve their lives. To date, CARE has supported more than 1.1 million people (74% women) who belong to 39,776 VSLAs across 30 Districts. These groups mobilize up to $25M each year and secure $21M loans from MFIs and SACCOs to invest in their wellbeing both individually and collectively. You can learn more about VSLAs here. 
VSLA members largely invest individually from loans accessed from their group and lump savings from the share out or in some cases, they invest as a group. The capital that VSLAs can raise with the members' own sources alone is not enough to address large financial constraints in value chain financing. The AgriFund model supports groups to access pooled funds to make larger-scale investments that would otherwise be inaccessible on the individual or single group level. Collective investment is an instrumental strategy that enables individuals to efficiently access and make use of goods and services that could have been very costly for individuals. Collective investments are fundamental for the group of farmers to gain economies of scale and move from subsistence farming to market-oriented agriculture.  These are achieved either through different activities like collective resources sourcing, collective decision making, collective production and marketing.
In Tanzania, the 2-year program entitled Her Money, Her Life, aims to increase independence and economic opportunities for women farmers to boost quality, quantity, productivity and diversification in Tanzania’s tea sector. The project has demonstrated tremendous potential to support women in VSLAs to achieve several shared goals while also driving impact for farmers, creating concrete market linkages across supply chains and establishing an enabling environment to drive ongoing investment in project communities The project secures women’s meaningful access to markets, supports them to fully participate in the tea, herbs and spices value chains, increases their incomes, and helps them achieve decision-making authority through economic autonomy. VSLAs have proven to be very effective in accelerating growth and building local capacity. Core to the program is to support VSLA members and groups to transition from taking individual loans for household level investment to collectively investing in a group enterprise. CARE facilitates the establishment of these platforms to incentivize women farmers to invest and leverage their own capital to address key constraints, increasing market access and potential for their own agri-business. This will reduce the risk for women farmers and processors, as well as increase return on investment for all involved parties.
As with the current CARE / Bloomberg project, key to the collective investment model is setting up a designated AgriFund as part of their saving group structure and management. The AgriFund provides a guarantee fund, mandated by the savings constitution, which will leverage private-sector incentives based on favorable terms, as well as additional capital and credit through financial institutions. Reducing risk and guaranteeing transactions along the market systems are key constraints that the collective investment model addresses.
The project now seeks to scale to Rwanda
Assessment objectives
CARE Rwanda is seeking a consultant for a 8-month engagement to execute a market landscape assessment and business case modeling project focused on increasing farmer income through agriculture and collective investment in Rwanda.
Assessment  objectives:
Conduct market landscape assessment: The consultant will first conduct a market landscape assessment to analyze various crop value chains (5 to 10 crops) across the country. In addition to their economic and agronomic feasibility, the crops should be assessed with four additional filters: Geopolitical considerations (e.g., safety and stability of regions growing the crop), government/political considerations (e.g., does the crop fit into the country’s agricultural strategy) and climate-smart considerations/ecosystem sustainability (i.e., does the crop avoid environmental degradation; is the crop resilient to drought and other climate-related risks); and social factors - what are the gendered opportunities and barriers to entry in each selected value chain
For each crop, the consultant should undertake a mapping of the relevant stakeholder groups throughout the value chain, including the private companies. The consultant should approach the market landscape assessment with the aim of better understanding existing value chains as well as identifying nascent value chains that have potential to be successfully developed through this project. After presentation of findings to the CARE team, 3-5 high potential crop value chains will be selected for deeper assessment in the following phases of the engagement.
Develop Collective Investment tiers: For each of the selected value chains, the consultant will define Collective Investment tiers and identify specific investments (agricultural inputs, machinery/equipment, storage / warehouses, etc.) that are congruent with the value chain context mapped in the previous activity. For example, a lower investment tier might include low-cost inputs like fertilizer and seedlings etc, a medium investment tier might include mid-range inputs like small-scale storage or nurseries, mini-irrigation kits, and a higher investment tier might include capital-intensive investments like processing facilities or purchase of land. In addition, what are the gendered opportunities and barriers to entry in each selected value chain; and determine whether or not this is realistic given legal parameters and project timelines
Conduct stakeholder mapping exercise: For each selected value chain, the Consultant will complete light-touch stakeholder mapping, with a deeper focus on local and regional companies, financial service providers; social enterprises that could potentially partner with CARE on the project, e.g., by leveraging their power as a buyer to guarantee orders and prices to farmers throughout the project lifecycle and beyond; and Business Development services in line with the selected value chains.
Develop business case simulations: The Consultant will model various business cases that calculate return on investment for 3-5 of the crops under the different tiers of collective investment, looking specifically at how the different investments identified in the previous activity are predicted to affect farmer income. The business case scenarios take into account salient, interrelated variables (e.g., yield, quality, inputs, infrastructure, and demand). The simulations will require market research and engagement with farmers and cooperatives, processors, and other groups, and will include the projected timeframe for a positive return on investment at each tier of investment. In addition, articulate how those banks should be engaged around collective investment especially how collective investment leads to accessing formal finance. Including which banks we can work with (in Rwanda, we work with several already)
Recommendation: The Consultant will produce a set of recommendations for the project team based on their findings.
 The Methodology
It is expected that the assessment will adopt a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Qualitative approaches might include in-depth interviews using focus group discussions (FGDs), document review, documenting case studies and Key Informant Interviews, while the quantitative approach includes Surveys and secondary information including Reports. The final proposed methodology will be agreed on with the consultant.

About Chance for Childhood
Chance for Childhood is an award-winning charity working in Africa to support the most vulnerable children, such as street children, disabled children, children affected by conflict and kids behind bars. Our vision is to fight for every child. We work with African visionary community leaders to implement locally relevant yet far-reaching projects that create lasting change within the justice, education, and social protection sectors. This enables us to focus on ‘hard to reach’ children, both in terms of their complex needs (e.g., street children with learning difficulties) and location (e.g., urban violent slums or remote rural areas). Together we make ideas and impact both sustainable and scalable to protect, educate and empower even more of the world’s most disadvantaged children.
Our interventions in Africa are in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
 Project background
Tubarere Mu Muryango is the implementation strategy for the National Childcare Reform which was established since 2013 with the goal of reintegrating children living in institutions and transform Rwanda’s childcare and protection system into a family-based system of care.  In 2016, a national assessment showed that over 4,000 children with disabilities were still residing in the institutions. In 2018, a baseline assessment showed that some parents were in need of additional support to care for their children with disabilities. 
To help parents find solutions to that problem, UNICEF in partnership with Chance for Childhood have started implementing “Family strengthening and Community based support for care of children with disabilities in families Programme” since July 2021.
This programme has three main objectives, such as to support those children and their families to access mainstream and disability-related services (education, healthcare, rehabilitation and social protection, child protection…). It also intends to facilitate parents/caregivers to access self-help groups and other community-based initiatives to respond to immediate special needs and build resilience for sustainable family-based care of their children with disabilities. The current programme also ensures that community-based structures have necessary knowledge/capacity to provide and support children with disabilities and their families.
The programme has so far mapped 6689 children with disabilities and/or developmental delays in Huye and Bugesera Districts; has trained 6689 parents of children with disabilities and grouped them in 146 Parents Support Groups which helps them to provide psychosocial support to one another. In this programme, 7858 referrals were made to hospitals, rehabilitation centres, Education (Early childhood, primary, special school and TEVT), social and child protection.   Out of the referrals made, about 30.34 % got the services whilst the remainder 69.66 % are still facing different challenges.
To respond to the issue concerning large group of children with multiple impairments who could not make it to the hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the programme created 138 rehabilitation sites whereby each site has about ten (10) children with disabilities attending the rehabilitation services twice a week.
Our monitoring assessments also showed that about 1310 children with disabilities need different assistive devices out of which, 220 devices were recently provided by Chance for Childhood in close collaboration with CECHE Foundation and UNICEF Rwanda. 
Assignment

Local authorities and community volunteers will be filmed in community and/or in the offices talking about how they have been trained and increased knowledge to support children with disabilities and their families. District officials (staff) talk about their particular experience with this project, emphasizing on district and community ownership.  The National Child Development Agency (NCDA) and National Council of Persons with Disabilities (NCPD) will be filmed in their offices talking about Government’s vision in supporting children with disabilities and their families and availing necessary services in the community to prevent institutionalization of CWDs and promote the rights of all children. Chance for Childhood staff will talk about the planning and implementation of the project, key lessons learned, challenges and how they were addressed as well as how possible it is to support children with disabilities in their families and communities.  UNICEF will give their appreciation of this project, and the actual intent to gradually support Government in building inclusive national child protection system and case management that support all families in need for protection and response to child protection risks.

Assignment
Programme brief
The consultant will be expected to produce a 10-15 -page (maximum) programme brief right from the various reports and monitoring documents provided by CfC team. The Programme brief should be a comprehensive package reflecting lessons learned from key milestones of the project:
Situation analysis conducted
Mapping of children with disabilities
Training the parents of children with disabilities
Parents Support Groups
Referrals and challenges associated
Home accessibility and locally affordable assistive devices for the families of CwDs
Disability sensitive messages through radio and community advocacy events
Training of existing community volunteers about how to support children with disabilities in the community.
Training of community frontline workers including the local authorities about how to provide inclusive services.
Engaging with district authorities (lessons and challenges)
Coordination of the intervention
  Purpose of the programme brief   
 Rationale
In order to achieve a successful reintegration of children with disabilities and prevent new family separation, it is necessary to think about innovative strategies to deliver results for children and their families; it is therefore very crucial to provide information to stakeholders working on child protection and disability inclusion for them to get different options especially those that are proven effective that can help to make tailored & comprehensive package of interventions aiming at supporting children with disabilities reintegrated from institutions back to families, and to improve community and family-based care by increasing accessibility/affordability of basic services as well as addressing social norms, stigma and discrimination like the current programme for prevention of new family separation.  The package of interventions should be adapted to the individual community and consider the wider national context of low-resourced countries like Rwanda; this entails prioritizing interventions that build on existing resources/strengths to boost the capacity of communities for delivery of quality services to children and building of families’ resilience to adequately nurture and raise their children. The programme brief would be a good documentation to think towards sustainability of the model project, and to open for scale-up by different stakeholders.
Objectives
The programme brief will help the government of Rwanda and its stakeholders to:
Document how the programme was developed
Document how the programme was implemented
What challenges were encountered and how they were dealt with
Know the extent to which mainstream and special services for children with disabilities are provided and challenges associated.
Know the extent to which access to parents’ peer support has helped parents restore their hope
Know how community volunteers and community frontline workers should play a key role in the family and community care of CwDs.
Know how to tackle stigma and discrimination in the family of a CwD and in the community.
Know how CfC addressed issues related to affordability concerns for rehabilitation services of CwDs through community rehabilitation sites and locally made assistive devices.
Provide insights on coordination and the role of districts authorities to promote community-based services to CWDs
 Target audiences
Government of Rwanda and its stakeholders in child protection, social and disability inclusion at all levels have interest in the programme brief in which they will be asked to play a role.  Table 1 below provides a preliminary stakeholder analysis, which should be deepened by the consultant during the documentation of the programme.
Accountability to targeted populations, is tied to CfC commitments to include people we work with as key stakeholders in their work. As such, CfC is committed to ensuring the involvement of children with disabilities, their guardians and parents and members of the support system including families of CwDs and respective communities.

About Chance for Childhood
Chance for Childhood is an award-winning charity working in Africa to support the most vulnerable children, such as street children, disabled children, children affected by conflict and kids behind bars. Our vision is to fight for every child.
We work with African visionary community leaders to implement locally relevant yet far-reaching projects that create lasting change within the justice, education, and social protection sectors. This enables us to focus on ‘hard to reach’ children, both in terms of their complex needs (e.g., street children with learning difficulties) and location (e.g., urban violent slums or remote rural areas). Together we make ideas and impact both sustainable and scalable to protect, educate and empower even more of the world’s most disadvantaged children. Our interventions in Africa are in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Background of the project
Tubarere Mu Muryango is the implementation strategy for the National Childcare Reform that was implemented since 2013 with the goal of reintegrating children living in institutions and transform Rwanda’s childcare and protection system into a family-based system of care.  In 2016, a national assessment showed that over 4,000 children with disabilities were still residing in the institutions. In 2018, a baseline assessment showed that some parents were in need for additional support to care for their children with disabilities.  
To help parents find solutions to that problem, UNICEF in partnership with Chance for Childhood have started implementing “Family strengthening and Community based support for care of children with disabilities in families Programme” since July 2021.
This programme has three main objectives, such as to support those children and their families to access mainstream and disability-related services (education, healthcare, rehabilitation and social protection, child protection…). It also intends to facilitate parents/caregivers to access self-help groups and other community-based initiatives to respond to immediate special needs and build resilience for sustainable family-based care of their children with disabilities. The current programme will also ensure that community-based structures have necessary knowledge/capacity to provide and support children with disabilities and their families.
The programme has so far mapped 6689 children with disabilities and/or developmental delays in Huye and Bugesera Districts; has trained 6689 parents of children with disabilities and grouped them in 146 Parents Support Groups which helps them to provide psychosocial support to one another. In this programme, 7858 referrals were made to hospitals, rehabilitation centres, Education (Early childhood, primary, special school and TEVT), social and child protection.   Out of the referrals made, about 30.34 % got the services whilst the remainder 69.66 % are still facing different challenges.
To respond to the issue concerning large group of children with multiple impairments who could not make it to the hospitals and rehabilitation centres, the programme created 138 rehabilitation sites whereby each site has about ten (10) children with disabilities attending the rehabilitation services twice a week.
Our monitoring assessments also showed that about 1310 children with disabilities need different assistive devices out of which, 220 devices were recently provided by Chance for Childhood in close collaboration with CECHE Foundation and UNICEF Rwanda.  
Purpose of the Midline survey
Rationale
The midline study and subsequent report is needed to assess the extent to which targets have been achieved thus far in the project, understand the determinants enabling and/or disabling achievement of targets, the extent of ownership built among the target groups, capture key learning from the implementation experience and recommend doable actions for the remaining project period.
Objectives
The objective of this midline survey is to see whether the project is on the right path to achieving what it is supposed to achieve, examine the possible enablers and disablers of the project achievements. This survey will also show the alternative ways to achieving sustainability and ownership by the government institutions.   
Stakeholders and Users
Several stakeholders both internal and outside of CfC have interest in the data collection and results of the Midline survey of these will be asked to play a role in the report. Table 1 below provides a preliminary stakeholder analysis, which should be deepened by the consultant during the inception and data collection phases.
Accountability to targeted populations, is tied to CfC commitments to include beneficiaries as key stakeholders in their work. As such, CfC is committed to ensuring the involvement of children with disabilities, their guardians and parents and members of the support system including families of CwDs and respective communities.

We support children’s rights from birth until they reach adulthood. And we enable children to prepare for – and respond to – crises and adversity. We drive changes in practice and policy at local, national and global levels using our reach, experience and knowledge.

 OUR PURPOSE, AMBITION AND OBJECTIVES
It’s tough for children to grow up safely. Across the world, poverty levels are rising, climate events and war continue to damage communities. Health is at risk from new treats and hunger. And an unequal access to information and education is holding back young people, especially girls. There can be no real change unless children are empowered to drive their own futures. When you join Plan International, you become an important part of achieving our purpose: We strive for a just world that advances Children’ rights and Equality for Girls. Our purpose guides and inspires everything we do.
Inspiration on its own cannot deliver the world we want to see. That’s why Plan International has a clear ambition for these coming years: We are working together to create a world where all girls know and exercise their rights to live a life they choose. With a supportive network, girls and young women can stand strong and shape their futures. Creating global change means a future in which girls no longer face the barriers and discrimination they face today, every minute of every day. This is our ambition: “All Girls Standing Strong Creating Global Change”.
Because we want to improve the lives of 200 million girls by 2027, we all need to work together with the same focus. Our three objectives give direction to our work. Supporting girls with powerful ways to take a stand against injustice. We will increase our impact to help girls living in fragile environments, and fight injustice. More girls will be educated safely, and learn vital life skills. We will also support girls to Lead in all aspects of their lives. We will enable them to Decide and take control of their lives and bodies. And will Thrive in a caring world, free from violence and fear. Our Global organisation has the privilege of power. We must use this correctly to empower our people working closely with the girls we support. Locally led work by colleagues and partners in communities will benefit from being globally connected. We will build long term partnerships, and design our programmes alongside young people and girls.
Plan International Rwanda and our Focus on Girls and Youth
Our global strategy “All Girls Standing Strong Creating Global Change” has 8 priorities among which focusing on girls’ rights in our priority number one and being youth cantered. In Plan International Rwanda we contribute to these global priorities, purpose and ambition through many projects including the Building Generation of Gender Equality through Girls Empowerment and Engaging Boys and men to adopt positive masculinity” or CNO FAD project.
The CNO Project Manager will be responsible for the overall implementation of the project and most importantly make sure our partners, girls and young people and Plan international Rwanda staff are engaged on our flagship campaign dubbed Girls Get Equal Campaign. The Girls Get Equal is a campaign for Girls Power, Voice and Leadership. The GGE campaign has three demands:
Girls Get Equal Power: Girls and Young women take part in all decision that affect their lives
Girls Get Equal Freedom: Girls and Young women are safe to live, move and speak up without fear of harassment and violence, whether that’s online or in public.
Girls Get Equal Representation: damaging gender stereotypes stop being promoted
For this financial year 23(04th October 2022 to September 2023) our focus is on the Girls Get Equal Power with a campaign called Equal Power Now demanding leaders, power holders at all level to prioritise meaningful participation of girls and young women in decision making spaces at all levels: homes, school, communities, corridors of powers…
She/he will lead all phases of the project management cycle; She/he will be responsible for ensuring that project activities and spending are on track and according to the work plan, that objectives are met and that all data are captured and analysed appropriately.

CHANCEN International is a non-profit organization that provides an ethical, fair, and responsible financing model for young people in Africa to access quality tertiary education. This financing model is called an Income Share Agreement (ISA) and was tried and tested for 20 years in Germany before being launched in East Africa in 2018. With an ISA financing model, CHANCEN International pays tuition fees during beneficiaries' tenure of their studies, and graduates pay them back according to their income at the end of their studies, thus making it possible to finance the next generation of students. CHANCEN administrative base is located in Kigali, Rwanda, and in its first two years of financing operations, more than 1300 young people accessed funds for their tertiary education. CHANCEN believes that young Africans are ready to take on the problems that have hold their continent back if they are fairly and responsibly empowered. Education is one of the vehicles for harnessing that potential, and we work to create equal access to high-quality tertiary education for traditionally excluded populations. Our unique and innovative model of responsible and sustainable financing has the power to unleash intergenerational economic mobility for marginalized youth as they gain the skills required to participate in building strong economies and peaceful nations.
CHANCEN International's next phase of growth comes with the launch of the Zamuka-Future of Work Fund, a non-deposit taking central bank regulated institution, which provides a blended investment opportunity for investors who want to ensure that the next generation of youth in Africa acquire employable skills and move into gainful employment. Our Income Share Agreement model has ensured students were able to continue their education to employment journey in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and the demand from both students and partner institutions have seen a sharp increase in recent months due to reduction in household income and the ability for excluded youth to pay for education.

The umbrella of Organizations of Persons with disabilities in the fight against HIV/AIDs and for health promotion (UPHLS),Consultancy,Consultancy Opportunity to Conduct a Formative Research on the Factors Contributing to Impairment in Children and Adolescents in Rwanda ,https://www.jobinrwanda.com/job/consultancy-opportunity-conduct-formative-research-factors-contributing-impairment-children-and,"Other, Public health",PhD  ,Senior (5+ years of experience), Contract,1,RW,327,"
Terms of Reference for Consultant
Consultancy opportunity to conduct a Formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda 
Background
Disability is a major public health concern worldwide and the situation for children with disabilities is even more serious. The CRPD states that “persons with disabilities include those who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others”. Some children will be born with a disabling health condition or impairment, while others may experience disability as a result of illness, injury or poor nutrition. Children with disabilities include those with health conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, traumatic spinal cord injury, Down syndrome, and children with hearing, visual, physical, communication and intellectual impairments. A number of children have a single impairment while others may experience multiple impairments. For example, a child with cerebral palsy may have mobility, communication and intellectual impairments. The complex interaction between a health condition or impairment and environmental and personal factors means that each child’s experience of disability is different.
It is estimated that, overall, between 500 and 650 million people worldwide live with a significant impairment. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 10 per cent of the world’s children and young people, have a sensory, intellectual or mental health impairment. Around 80 per cent of them live in developing countries. Statistics such as these demonstrate that to be born with or acquire an impairment is far from being unusual or abnormal. Specialists, however, agree on a working approximation giving a minimum benchmark of 2.5 per cent of children aged 0-14 with self-evident moderate to severe levels of sensory, physical and intellectual impairments. An additional 8 per cent can be expected to have learning or behavioral difficulties, or both.
The Fourth Rwanda Population and Housing Census (2012 RPHC) reports revealed approximately 20% (87,900) of the population of persons with disabilities are children between the ages of five and eighteen. Many of disabling conditions in children are preventable. In Africa, one of the foremost causes of disability are infectious and communicable disease; the incidence of these diseases have been greatly reduced or eliminated in higher income countries. Other causes include war, trauma, accidents, and congenital and Non communicable diseases. 
Early identification, referral and management of impairments in children has been emphasized by the National policy of persons with disabilities and its four years’ strategic plan (2021-2024) especially the strategic objective related to the strengthening of early identification, diagnostic assessment, and intervention, prioritizing children with disabilities. In response  to this, different interventions are being carried out within the health sector. However, lack of evidence on disability determinants and factors contributing to the impairment in children constitute a hindrance to the good performance of the above mentioned interventions. 
In partnership with RBC, NCPD and NCDA under the financial and technical support of the UNICEF, UPHLS is planning to conduct a formative Research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda. The research shall include the improvement plan. 
It is therefore worthy to conduct the formative research on the factors contributing to impairment in children and adolescents in Rwanda in order to have the strategies to address identified factors. Once conducted, the research findings will not only inform policy makers’ planning but also provide guidance on management and/or referral of different types of major impairments in children.

Educate! prepares youth in Africa with the skills to succeed in today’s economy. We've created a 100-hour experience that delivers the most essential skills youth need to transition to work, combining training, mentorship, and practical experience starting a business. We deliver this experience to youth in 3 ways: directly to schools, integrated into education systems, and through bootcamps for out-of-school youth.
All three delivery channels have been validated by several independent evaluations, and to date, more than 200,000 youth have been meaningfully impacted by this model across Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya. Along the way, Educate! has become the largest youth skills provider in East Africa.

Why You Will Brag About Working At Educate!
We’ve got the impact.
Educate! is designed for scale. We quadrupled operations in 2019, Serving more than 1200 schools. We carefully measure our outcomes, and — here’s the best part — we are maintaining quality at four times the size.
We believe in local leadership — 96% of our staff is African.
Our model has gone nationwide in Uganda — Educate!’s model is now incorporated into the national curriculum and exams, impacting many thousands more students than we can reach directly.
Educate is a well-oiled learning machine. We built our model by methodically testing hundreds of assumptions and we are constantly experimenting, evaluating, and improving.
We’re honored that luminaries and leaders like Oliver Wonekha, the Ugandan Ambassador to the US, and Ann Veneman, a former Secretary of Agriculture and head of Unicef, believe in us enough to have joined our advisory board.
 What Is Educate! About?
We’re ambitious. Are you? Educate! is growing fast, so new opportunities are opening up and expanding all the time. We’re inspired by people with drive, and we love to help them reach their full potential. We expect everyone at Educate! to contribute above and beyond their job description, grow their skills, and advance their careers, and we are committed to supporting our staff members on that journey.
We Put Youth First - The youth we serve come first. Always. In everything. That means we wake up thinking of ways we can serve youth even better and get the highest impact out of every dollar that we spend. It means Educate! doesn’t own a single vehicle, because we’d rather take the bus if it means one more student can participate. It means making every decision like the future depends on it — because if we get our way, it does.
We Are Always Learning - When you work at Educate!, educating yourself is part of your job too. We encourage every employee to find the best book on management; share the latest article on graphic design; bring in your favorite college mentor; or meet the researcher pushing the edge of the field. We are always thirsty for knowledge and love to share.
We Only Solve a Problem Once - We are allergic to band-aids so we love the person who brings the new system to solve the problem for good, even problems we haven’t recognized yet.
We Are Flexible - We thrive on change — we’re driving it. We are growing every day, so we have to adapt quickly to meet new challenges, and our team keeps up.
We Exceed Expectations - We assume we can achieve the impossible because we already have, year after year. We want our staff to create your own challenges, ask the toughest questions, and dream scary big!
Every person at Educate! — from interns to the executive director — is evaluated by how they live up to these five cultural tenets. They are at the core of how we achieve our mission and why we work as well as we do.
Educate is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all who interact in our community.  In creating this environment, we encourage people from a variety of cultures, backgrounds and life experiences to join our diverse team.

The project will be implemented in four districts, seven sectors and 249 villages, which constitutes 10-12 percent of the villages in the project districts. The total population in the target villages, according to official data, is 152,645. This entire number is expected to benefit from improved village planning and engagement with local government, including enhanced understanding of and access to government social protection programs. On average, approximately 70 households in each target village will attend meetings and benefit from a range of activities, including capacity-building for planning and savings groups. This equates to 17,750 HH, for a total of approximately 76,000 direct beneficiaries.
The project has two sets of beneficiaries. The first group is the rural poor at the village level in the targeted areas, who will benefit from: (a) technical support to engage in participatory village planning and prepare a Village Development Plan (VDP); and (b) a small grant to implement priority livelihood sub-projects identified in the VDP. Experience also suggests that the project approach enhances participation in Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs). By strengthening communication between government and village members, it also generates welfare benefits through increased uptake of government social protection programmes by the rural poor.
The second group of beneficiaries will be government officials and institutions at the national and sub-national levels who will benefit from technical support on: (a) citizen engagement and participatory planning and; (b) how to translate this practical experience into a national framework on participatory village planning. At the village level, the project will directly benefit approximately 85,000 people (50 percent gender split) across 249 villages. The direct beneficiaries are the members of the estimated 80 households in each village who will attend regular weekly meetings to be facilitated by the project. They are also expected to benefit from increased capacity for planning, improved uptake of government social protection programs and from the micro-grant under component two. There will be 152,645 indirect beneficiaries, which is the total population in the target villages, who are expected to benefit from improved village planning and engagement with local government.
Villages will benefit in two ways: (a) participation in village planning and attendance at weekly meetings, which will increase their capacity to engage with local government; and (b) livelihood improvements from increased uptake of government social protection programs, the Micro-grant project and savings groups. Those in the lowest income brackets (Ubudehe 3 and 4 categories) and families will be included through mobilization strategies, including having zone representatives who encourage all households in their village zone to attend meetings, having someone alert households to the village meeting beforehand, and asking villagers to encourage their immediate neighbors to come and walk with them to the meeting. Participation by all village members is encouraged by emphasizing that everyone’s voice is important, appreciating those who provide input and a common understanding that contributions from all households are critical to successful collective action.
The project will benefit national and sub-national government officials to connect the demand and supply-sides. Local Government officials are responsible for citizen engagement but do not always have enough skills to lead participatory processes. The project will support the district, sector, and cell-level officials to prepare participatory village plans. The project will also benefit national-level officials in the ministries in charge of finance and local government by providing technical assistance to prepare a national framework for participatory village planning.
The project is currently being implemented in 7 sectors in Gakenke, Gicumbi, Burera, and Huye districts in two of Rwanda’s four provinces (Northern and Southern province). Within these provinces, a list of target districts was prepared, based on official household profiling and livelihood data provided by LODA and MINALOC, and considering the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19. Sectors were selected based on an assessment of poverty levels, the numbers of people in Ubudehe categories 1 and 2 and malnutrition rates, using data submitted by the District. After shortlisting 4-5 sectors per district, the final decision on project sites was made based on readiness to implement the project (e.g., full complement of SEDOs in place) and limited presence of other NGO or development partner programs. This resulted in the final list of four districts and seven sectors, which has been approved by the respective District.

Within the target sectors, all villages will be covered (a ‘sector saturation’ model), in order to capitalize on the investments in capacity development of local government officials. All households/people in each village are eligible to participate in meetings and decisions, run for local leadership, and benefit from activities in the VDPs, including microgrant-funded through sub-projects. The project will pay particular attention to improving the voice and representation of women and people in low-income categories as well as youth and persons with disabilities. The participation of people in these groups will be tracked throughout the project.

Short Term Consultancy to Develop Tailored Loan Products for the Health Sector in Rwanda
Company Information 
Palladium is a global leader in the design, development, and delivery of Positive Impact - the intentional creation of enduring social and economic value. We work with foundations, investors, governments, corporations, communities, and civil society to formulate strategies and implement solutions that generate lasting social, environmental, and financial benefits. For the past 50 years, we have been making Positive Impact possible. With a team of more than 2,500 employees operating in 90 plus countries and a global network of more than 35,000 technical experts, Palladium has improved - and is committed to continuing to improve - economies, societies and most importantly, people's lives.  
2.  Project Summary 
Palladium is implementing the Rwanda Integrated Health Systems Activity (RIHSA), a three-year USAID-funded task order (720-696-20-F-00001) designed to support the Ministry of Health in strengthening Rwanda’s health system to provide quality health care for Rwandans while building the capacity of the Government of Rwanda (GOR) to move away from a donor-financed health system towards a self-reliant system. The project is aimed at achieving two major objectives:
Reduce financial barriers to health care through a mix of public and private interventions and provide tools for improved domestic resource mobilization and improve health care financing for the GOR.
 Improve the quality of essential health services at national, facility and community levels utilizing a health systems approach. 
Through a focus on financing and quality, USAID-RIHSA provides technical assistance to the GOR on various strategies, tools and approaches that will allow Rwanda to sustainably fund its healthcare system and provide quality care at all levels. The Activity is implemented by a consortium led by Palladium International LLC (Palladium) in partnership with RTI International, the Council for Health Service Accreditation of Southern Africa (COHSASA), Zenysis Technologies, and the Rwanda Agency for Accreditation and Quality of Healthcare (RAAQH).
3.    Context
The Government of Rwanda has prioritized the private sector as a critical partner in its efforts to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Some of the priority areas of the GOR for private health investment include provision of specialized diagnostic and treatment services (e.g. medical imaging & diagnostic laboratories), manufacturing of medical supplies and equipment (e.g. medical implants, medicine and medical equipment), among others. To achieve this, financing is needed to either construct health facilities, acquire equipment, expand existing facilities or meet running costs. In Rwanda, the health products portfolio in financial institutions is still relatively small has potential for growth. A recent survey on financing opportunities for the private health sector in Rwanda highlighted the limited existence of health-related loan products in the market, with some of the few products available requiring high collateral requirements and offering unfavorable interest rates. While financial institutions view the sector as risky with high potential for credit loss, they also face challenges related to understanding the needs and dynamics of the health sector and thus find it challenging to tailor loan products for this sector. Consequently, health sector entrepreneurs continuously grapple with limited access to credit facilities amidst the financial constraints posed by delayed reimbursements from insurance providers. In addition, the changing epidemiological profile and healthcare needs of the population calls for the adoption of new and effective technologies, and the employment of highly skilled personnel, which come at a very high cost hence the need for comprehensive financial solutions to meet Healthcare Sector funding requirements. In light of the above, USAID RIHSA is commissioning a consultancy to formulate better strategies towards unlocking the needed finance (with favorable terms) for the private health sector.
4.    Objective & scope of work
The objective of this assignment is to support selected Financial Institutions in Rwanda to develop at least two loan products tailored to the health sector, and/or modify existing products to meet the needs and dynamics of the health sector (including Hospitals, Clinics, Health Posts, Medical Laboratories and Diagnostic Centers and Pharmacies among others).
5.    Expected Deliverables
The consultant is expected to develop at least two (2) loan products tailored to the health sector financing needs. The consultant shall:
1.Engage Financial Institutions (Banks and MFIs) to shortlist those that are interested in direct product development support.
2. From the shortlisted institutions, review their existing health sector loan products including features of the product(s), disbursement history/trends and client feedback on the product (s),
3. Work closely with product development teams from the selected financial institutions to scope, identify, and design at least 2 new loan products and/or improve existing ones targeting health sector clients.

CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT A BASELINE SURVEY FOR EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON SOCIAL-ECONOMIC STATUS OF COOPERATIVES AND HOUSEHOLD’S BUSINESSES in KARONGI and RUTSIRO DISTRICTS
 About TUBIBE AMAHORO
TUBIBE AMAHORO is a non-profit, community-based organization currently operating in Karongi, Rutsiro and Ngororero districts of Western province, and Burera district in Northern Province. Its main goal is to achieve a society in which laws and rights are respected by everyone, and its mission is to promote respect of human rights and integral socioeconomic progress of Rwandan population by emphasizing gender promotion, civic participation, access to justice and environmental protection and rural development. 
Background
In the last two years, the world faced a severe and acute public health emergency due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. The pandemic and its response, in the form of protracted nationwide lockdowns, have had several short-term as well as long-term impacts on human health, society, the economy, and the environment. Particularly, the Pandemic has deeply affected businesses and jobs. Globally and in Rwanda as well, companies (Micro, small, and medium enterprises) were under strain due to unfavorable working conditions imposed by the Pandemic.  The economic conditions slowdown forced the families to initiate serious decisions on usual spending. This with many other decisions explains several impacts associated with Covid-19. School dropout and a sharp increase in GBV, conflicts, and domestic violence were among the most severe social conditions currently society is facing. Addressing social and economic problems induced and accelerated by Covid-19, the Government of Rwanda through its various ministries and in collaboration with international organizations, non-government organizations, and other agencies in consultation with various economic stakeholders and development partners in formulating and implementing plans to expand its social protection programs and to increase economic support. 
Under the fund from Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), TUBIBE AMAHORO is implementing the project titled “Fostering citizens’ self-reliance to mitigate COVID-19 effects in Karongi and Rutsiro districts”. The diverse impacts of COVID-19 in Rwanda as well as in project target districts were severe distinctively. In this regard, TUBIBE AMAHORO is willing to hire a consultancy firm that will conduct a baseline survey aimed to identify social-economic impacts imposed by COVID-19. The baseline survey is expected to provide the basic information guiding the organization to record and consider provided recommendations for future decisions regarding the implementation of the project in order to mitigate COVID-19 impacts on social and economic conditions. The primary objective of the present survey is to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on social-economic statuses of citizens from the target districts. Specifically, the effects of COVID-19 on GBV increase and household and cooperative businesses should be cleared and propose the possible mitigation measures. In addition, based on the project outcomes, the consultant will need to identify the vulnerable groups of businesses and people mostly affected by GBV and business shutdown during the pandemic to further orient organizational resources in terms of mitigations and adaptations to COVID-19 imposed conditions.
The qualified and experienced consultants and consulting firms previously worked in social-economic impacts assessment are therefore allowed to compete basing on the following directive pre-process and further process detailed within the Terms of Reference.

To learn more about our work, take a look at our Why Work Here blog for information.
About the Role
We've set ourselves a bold target to plant 1 billion trees in the next 8 years. We need you to help us achieve it.
In Rwanda alone, we have planted over 50M trees in the last 4 years, and our tree program distributes over 20 million trees, to over 1 million farmers annually. We do this through the hybrid production model (producing tree seedlings from 6 central nurseries and over 1,000 decentralized nurseries) and a distribution model that uses our partnership with the Rwandan government's extension network, Twigire Muhinzi.
Yet despite these major successes we have a lot more to do to reach our potential: a) scale the program beyond 20 million trees per year b) increase impact per farmer by improving the tree products we offer, performance (e.g. survival), diversification, intensification, and market access c) increase program sustainability by finding ways to generate an income (e.g. accessing financing opportunities, such as the carbon credit market, or monetizing portions of our work), or improve efficiency
We are looking for an experienced program manager to lead our growing tree department
You will oversee our priority projects that can dramatically improve the tree program impact, scale and efficiency outcomes over the next 3-5 years.
You will lead a team of 50 + staff and support them to achieve the organization's objectives
You will report directly to the Extension Lead
Responsibilities
This is an exciting opportunity to lead a growing department that inspires some of the largest impacts in the organization. The department lead will:
1) Coach leaders: Oversee our yearly tree campaign. You will primarily support and empower leaders to run our tree campaign independently and come up with their own strategy
2) Prioritize collaboratively building longer-term strategies: so that a) the decisions we make today, support our strategic priorities tomorrow b) team leads can develop shorter-term strategies c) the tree program supports wider organizational goals (e.g. commercialization)
3) Strategic innovations: build and oversee a culture where major and minor innovations are identified, tested and scaled, and ensure they are contributing to wider organizational priorities. Our current priorities include:
Find ""right size"" tree packages,
Maximize tree survival,
Maximize planting on consolidated land,
Use our grower network to create more impact and business opportunities,
Test carbon credit opportunities, and run field trials to recommend promising ones to grow
Evaluate the opportunities to increase the value of timber in Rwanda
4) Guide our organization's initiative to collaborate with actors in the sector to improve Rwanda's tree system: Lead on strategic partner management and system change analysis, to deliver system-wide impacts
Career Growth and Development
We have a strong culture of constant learning and we invest in developing our people. You’ll have weekly check-ins with your manager, access to mentorship and training programs, and regular feedback on your performance. We hold career reviews every six months and set aside time to discuss your aspirations and career goals.

3+ years experience leading and growing team
2+ years in program management, preferably experience in agriculture extension, scaling and expanding programs, with an emphasis on systems building and innovations

About the Role

We require a candidate who is willing to make it their life's mission for the next two years to grow the best quality seed for Rwandan farmers and to navigate any challenge this process throws at them with patience, positivity and passion. This project aims to bring the highest quality potato seed to tens of thousands of Rwandan farmers. This work will create hundreds of thousands of dollars of impact by increased harvest and nutrition for farm households within the next two years.

Develop our existing partners and new partners into quality early-generation potato seed producers. Where beneficial/necessary build partnerships with government organizations, regulatory bodies, farm cooperatives, seed companies and other partners to ensure the success of the program
